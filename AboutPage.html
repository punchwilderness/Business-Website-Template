                    Consonantia,
                    there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
                    Semantics, a
                    large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
                    necessary
                    regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

                    Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic
                    life
                    One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far
                    World
                    of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                    Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she
                    reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her
                    hometown
                    Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
